Both the Meltdown and Spectre attacks use CPU cache as a side channel to steal a protected secret. Thei
technique used in this side-channel attack is called FLUSH+RELOAD.
The objective of this task is to use the side channel to extract a secret value used by the victim function.
Assume there is a victim function that uses a secret value as index to load some values from an array. 
Question: are we assuming that the secret variable is being loaded by the victim function?
Also
assume that the secret value cannot be accessed from the outside. Our goal is to use side channels to get this
secret value. The technique that we will be using is called FLUSH+RELOAD.
STEP1: Flush the cache to ensure that our array isn't already in the cache. This ensures that we, the adversary, are not cheating.

STEP 2: Invoke the victim function, which accesses one of the array elements based on the value of the secret.
This action causes the corresponding array element to be cached. 

STEP 3: RELOAD the entire array, and measure the time it takes to reload each element. If one specific
elementâ€™s loading time is fast, it is very likely that element is already in the cache. This element must
be the one accessed by the victim function. Therefore, we can figure out what the secret value is.`:q
